### Usage

```python

alt.themes.enable("feedzai")
```

You can find some example charts in the [`demo.ipynb` notebook](demo.ipynb).

## Development

Assuming [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) is installed, install Python:

```bash
uv python install
```

Create and activate the development environment:

```bash
uv sync
```

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

After implementing changes, type-check with mypy, then lint and format the code with Ruff:

```bash
mypy
```

```bash
ruff check --fix
```

```bash
ruff format
```

To see the changes applied to some example charts, use the [`demo.ipynb` notebook](demo.ipynb):

```bash
jupyter lab demo.ipynb
```

Once done, deactivate the development environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

## Deployment

### Bump the package version

```bash
uv version --bump patch
```

```bash

```

Next, confirm you can build the package locally:

```bash
git tag -n
```

```bash
git push origin --tags
```
